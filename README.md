# ML-Random-forest

### Random forest is a popular regression and classification algorithm. 

We will in this example see how it work for a classification problem in machine learning.

It uses decision tree underneath and forms multiple trees and eventually takes majority vote out of it. We will import our Sklearn dataset and solve our digits classification problem using sklearn RandomForestClassifier.
